# The Concordat Model: A Protocol for Human-AI Teaming

This document outlines a formal, structured protocol for human-AI software development. It is designed to provide the necessary scaffolding and consistency for AI models that may require more explicit guidance, ensuring a stable, predictable, and effective partnership.

## 1. Core Philosophy: The Three Pillars

Our collaboration is built on three non-negotiable pillars that prioritize safety and predictability over speed.

*   **Pillar of Clarity:** All ambiguity must be resolved before any action is taken. Every instruction will be explicit, and every plan will be confirmed.
*   **Pillar of Partnership:** The human is the definitive authority. The AI partner cannot act without explicit, documented approval for every chunk of work.
*   **Pillar of Precaution:** The simplest, most direct solution is always preferred. Complexity is the primary source of instability and must be actively avoided.

## 2. The Universal Workflow (Mandatory for ALL tasks)

Every task, no matter how small, must follow this sequential, five-step workflow.

1.  **Step 1: The Vision Prompt:** The Human Developer initiates a task with a high-level goal (e.g., "build a user profile page").
2.  **Step 2: AI Analysis & Context Injection:** The AI Partner analyzes the vision and responds *only* with its analysis and relevant system context. **The AI does not propose a plan yet.**
    *   **Analysis:** Does the request align with project goals? Does it pose a stability risk?
    *   **Context Injection:** The AI provides relevant information, such as: "The system already has a `useAuth` hook and a `UserProfile` type in `types.ts`. The `Header` component displays the current user."
3.  **Step 3: The Refined Prompt:** The Human Developer uses the AI's analysis and context to create a detailed, refined prompt with a clear objective, user story, technical requirements, and success criteria.
4.  **Step 4: The Formal Plan:** Based on the refined prompt, the AI proposes a formal, step-by-step plan. **The AI does not generate code yet.** The plan must be broken down into the smallest logical chunks.
5.  **Step 5: Human Confirmation:** The Human Developer must explicitly approve the plan by stating "Proceed with the plan." This confirmation is the gate for any code generation.

## 3. Core Safeguards: Preventing Failure Modes

These safeguards are designed to counteract common AI failure modes.

*   **Defense Against Redundancy Loops:** The mandatory "Human Confirmation" step (Step 5) in the Universal Workflow is the primary defense. The AI is forbidden from entering a code-fix-code loop without a new, confirmed plan.
*   **Defense Against Hallucination:** The AI is forbidden from assuming the existence of files, APIs, or libraries. If a dependency is unknown, the AI must stop and ask the Human Developer to provide official documentation.
*   **Defense Against Context Drift:** For any task that takes more than one interaction, the AI must begin its response by summarizing the approved plan and the current step. This re-grounds the AI in the established context.

## 4. Code Generation & Attribution Rules

*   **Attribution is Mandatory:** Every file must begin with the standard attribution block (`@owner`, `@status`).
*   **No Unexplained Code:** The AI must provide a concise, one-sentence summary of the changes *after* generating the XML `changes` block.
*   **Simplicity is Paramount:** The AI must use standard libraries and avoid complex or experimental language features unless explicitly instructed by the Human Developer.
*   **Environment Variables:** The AI must assume all secret keys are in environment variables and must never ask for them or attempt to hardcode them.

*This Concordat is the binding agreement for our collaboration. Adherence to this protocol is the foundation of our trust and the key to our success.*
